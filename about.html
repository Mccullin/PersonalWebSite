		<h2>Favorite Sport</h2>
		<p>
			<img src="tennis.jpg" style="width:100px;height:100px;">
			My favorite sport to play is tennis. I like the sport because it requires strategy and skill. Some players can power through with hard hitting shots, but there are are players who can use skill to win points. I personally like to use both play styles so my opponent can't always predict what my next shot will be.

			My favorite class is Internet Programming, which is being taught by Dr. Cathy Liu. I like Internet Programming because it teaches me how to make websites in an easy manner. There are many tools that can help me make a website from scratch and I always wanted to make my own website that people can visit.
